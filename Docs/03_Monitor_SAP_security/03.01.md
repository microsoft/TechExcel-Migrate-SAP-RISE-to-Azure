## Task 01: Explore the Sentinel data connector

### Description

In these steps, you'll explore the Microsoft Sentinel data connector specifically designed for SAP systems. You'll navigate through the Azure portal to locate the SAP data connector, review its configuration, and verify the health and connectivity of the agent-based setup. This ensures that log data from SAP is being correctly collected and made available for security analytics.

### Success criteria

- The SAP data connector is located and opened in Microsoft Sentinel.
- The agent health and connectivity status are reviewed.
- The connector is confirmed to be collecting logs from SAP systems.
