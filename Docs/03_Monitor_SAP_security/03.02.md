## Task 02: Explore workbooks

### Description

Installing the SAP Solution for Sentinel causes the system to install three SAP-specific workbook templates. Workbook templates allow you to visualize data that you've collected in pre-defined ways. In these steps, you'll open and explore the SAP-specific workbook templates installed with the Sentinel solution. These templates provide visual insights into SAP log data, including failed logons and access trends. You'll interact with filters and refresh visualizations to understand how data is presented.

### Success criteria

- SAP workbook templates are accessed in Microsoft Sentinel.
- Filters are applied and visualizations are refreshed.
- Key insights from the workbook are identified and interpreted.
