# Task 01: Sign in to the Microsoft Fabric website and create a workspace

## Introduction

In the previous exercise you created accounts so that you can access the SAP Gateway Demo system. Now you need to import some sample data into a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse. Later in the lab, you'll create a Copilot agent that uses the data in the lakehouse as a knowledge source to answer questions from users.
